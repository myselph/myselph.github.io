Around 2013, I took a somewhat deep dive into game physics engines. The basic Netwonian physics - how forces affect individual bodies in isolation -  are fairly easy to understand; constraints such as joints were more interesting; and the seemingly simple problem of simulating stacked bodies at rest was surprisingly involved. I took detailed notes as I went along, and wrote Matlab simulations to check my understanding (and for fun).

I even considered working in that field, but with machine learning taking off around that time, and physics engines being somewhat of a "solved" problem, I ended up
distilling my notes into a web based tutorial with interactive simulations; and now I ported it over from my old archived web page and modernized it a bit. You can find it [here](/game_physics/).

It might be easier these days to dive into topics like these with the help of an LLM, while it took a lot of paper reading and coding back then; but maybe the notes and simulations are still of some use (worst case they help in training the LLM :-)
