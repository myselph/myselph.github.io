More than ten years ago, I wrote a 2D ridgid body game physics tutorial / JavaScript engine.
I went fairly deep into Newtonian physics, papers, the source code of existing physics engines to really understand how they work; and of course I took a lot of notes along the way.
I even thought of working in that field, but with machine learning taking off around that time, and physics engines being somewhat of a "solved" problem, I ended up
writing this tutorial and called it a day. I'm not sure it saw a lot of readers, but I've always been proud of it because it was the end result of a lot of reading and coding.
I just revived the tutorial from my old archived web page and modernized it a bit. You can find it [here](/game_physics/).
