There is a large number of literature about physics engines available online. The problem is, some tutorials and papers are based on outdated methods (constraint forces for resting and colliding contacts); others are rather scientific and hard to deal with if one doesn't have an intuitive understanding of the material beforehand; and yet others simply omit the hard parts or the math and show the "obvious" parts of game physics, only. Here is an ordered list of material I found very useful:

- [Tonge (2013)](https://storage.googleapis.com/google-code-archive-downloads/v2/code.google.com/box2d/Tonge_Richard_PhysicsForGame.pdf) - very good overview of PhysX. Read this to get started with physics engines. I'd skip the LCP part if you are new to it.
- [Catto (2009)](https://storage.googleapis.com/google-code-archive-downloads/v2/code.google.com/box2d/GDC2009_ErinCatto.zip) - Excellent introduction to impulse-based constraint solvers. Also contains slimmed down version of Box2D.
- SIGGRAPH 2001 course:
    1. [Baraff (2001)](https://graphics.pixar.com/pbm2001/pdf/notesg.pdf) for 3D unconstrained motion
    2. [Witkin (2001)](https://graphics.pixar.com/pbm2001/pdf/notesf.pdf) on computing constraint forces
- [Garstenauer (2006)](https://github.com/helmut-g/Physics-Engine-Thesis) - very good in-depth thesis. Not too good for starters, but the most and best structured material on constraint solvers I've seen so far
- [literature list](https://pybullet.org/Bullet/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=63) in the Bullet forum
- [Slides](https://storage.googleapis.com/google-code-archive-downloads/v2/code.google.com/bullet/GDC2013_ErwinCoumans_GPU_rigid_body_simulation.pdf) and [paper](https://www.multithreadingandvfx.org/course_notes/GPU_rigidbody_using_OpenCL.pdf) of Erwin Coumans' [Bullet](http://www.bulletphysics.org/) 3.0 rewrite to include GPU support. Contains a lot of useful information about Bullet internals.
- The code in my demos is intentionally very succinct, close to the text, and unoptimized to keep it as readable as possible. There are full blown Javascript physics engines; e.g., Stefan Hedberg wrote both a 2D and 3D engine in Js called [Cannon.js](https://github.com/schteppe/cannon.js).

Once you know the *jargon* - velocity vs. force constraints, LCPs, AABBs etc. - it's easy to find more in-depth material.
