# Notes on usage

* For development, `npm run dev` to start localhost:4321 dev server, and automatically rebuilding files on changes.
* Pages in src/pages can be markdown (md, mdx) or astro
* static artifacts - pdfs, images - go into public/
* src/assets is for artifacts like images that may be resized or processed by Astro
* src/content is similar to pages but think of it more as a DB of pages (eg blog posts) queried elsewhere
